### Why This Initiative?

Driven by the need for a centralized, comprehensive resource platform in our field, we founded PedestrianDynamics.org. Our vision is to maintain transparency and openness. While we might be the primary editors and hosts, we stress that this platform does not represent any private interest or corporate entity. Instead, it stands as a beacon for collective knowledge, collaboration, and advancement in pedestrian dynamics.

**Everyone is welcome to contribute, learn, and expand their horizons.**
